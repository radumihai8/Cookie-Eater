# Cookie Eater - 8x8 Matrix Game

## Backstory:

This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Robotics course.

The game is inspired by classic arcade games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders, and I wanted to create a simple but challenging game that could be enjoyed by players of all skill levels. 

It was a fun and challenging process, and I learned a lot along the way.

I hope you have fun playing Cookie Eater!

## Description:

Cookie Eater is a winter-themed game set in a snowy 8x8 matrix. In this game, you play as a pixelated character with the goal of eating as many cookies as possible before the time runs out.

There are three levels to play through, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles. The value of the cookies increases as you progress through the levels, starting at one point per cookie in the first level and increasing to two points per cookie in the second level and five points per cookie in the final level. The amount of time you have to eat the cookies also decreases with each level, starting at 30 seconds in the first level, 20 seconds in the second level, and 10 seconds in the final level.

The number of lives you start with is based on the difficulty setting you choose. On the easy setting, you start with three lives. On the medium setting, you start with two lives. On the hard setting, you have only one life.

As you progress through the levels, you'll face an increasingly difficult challenge: a horizontal wall that moves across the screen. This wall starts out relatively short in the first level, but it gets longer and faster as you progress through the game. If you get caught in the wall's path, you'll lose a life.

Can you navigate through the snowy matrix and become the ultimate cookie eater? Play Cookie Eater and find out!
